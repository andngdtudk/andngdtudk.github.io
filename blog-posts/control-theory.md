# Control Theory: Foundation and Practice (Demo)

Control theory is a branch of engineering and mathematics that focuses on modeling, analyzing, and designing systems whose behavior can be influenced by external inputs. It aims to determine how to manipulate a system's inputs—called control signals—to produce desired outputs or behaviors over time. Control theory is widely used in various fields, including robotics, aerospace, automotive engineering, economics, and biology. At its core, it involves understanding the dynamics of a system (how it evolves with time), measuring its performance, and designing feedback mechanisms that automatically adjust the system's behavior to meet performance goals such as stability, speed, accuracy, and robustness to disturbances or uncertainties.

In a typical system, such as a car cruise control or robotic arm, we want the output (like speed or position) to follow a desired reference value. Control theory helps us model the system dynamics and design controllers to achieve that behavior.

The mathematical foundation of control systems often starts with state-space models:

$$
\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t) \\
y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t)
$$

Here,  
- \( x(t) \): state vector  
- \( u(t) \): control input  
- \( y(t) \): measured output

These models can be linear or nonlinear, continuous or discrete.

## Applications

Control theory is used in many areas:

- **Robotics** – controlling joint positions and torques  
- **Aerospace** – stabilizing aircraft and spacecraft  
- **Automotive** – adaptive cruise control and stability  
- **Biology** – modeling population dynamics  
- **Economics** – predicting feedback in economic systems
